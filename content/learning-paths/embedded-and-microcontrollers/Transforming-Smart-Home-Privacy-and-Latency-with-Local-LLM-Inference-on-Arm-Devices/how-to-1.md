## Overview

Imagine controlling your smart home using natural language—no cloud connection, no third-party servers, just your own hardware. With rapid advances in Generative AI and the widespread availability of **Arm architecture**, it’s now possible to bring large language models (LLMs) directly into your home, running on accessible, affordable Arm-based devices.

**Arm processors** power a vast ecosystem of single-board computers (SBCs) and edge AI platforms—from Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson to Khadas and Odroid boards—enabling efficient, high-performance AI processing close to where your data is generated. By building on Arm, you benefit from energy efficiency, scalability, and support from a massive global developer community.

This learning path will show you how to create a fully local, privacy-first GenAI-powered smart home system leveraging the unique strengths of the Arm architecture. You’ll use open-source tools like **Ollama** to run powerful language models on your Arm-based hardware. With this approach, your voice commands and automations stay private and fast, unlocking advanced AI experiences for any room—**all made possible by the performance and versatility of Arm.**

## Why Local GenAI for Smart Homes?

Most commercial smart home assistants depend on cloud services, meaning your voice and data are constantly sent to external servers for processing. While convenient, this raises privacy concerns, creates dependence on internet connectivity, and introduces unpredictable latency. By running everything locally, you gain:

- **Total Privacy:** Your conversations and routines never leave your device.
- **Reliability:** Works even if your internet connection drops.
- **Low Latency:** Get instant responses without waiting on the cloud.
- **Customization:** Add new “skills” and device integrations as you wish.

Whether you’re a maker, developer, or privacy-conscious smart home enthusiast, this project gives you complete control.

## Supported Devices

You can run this project on a wide variety of Arm-powered single-board computers and edge AI devices, including:

- **Raspberry Pi 4 / 5**

  A versatile and affordable platform for home automation and prototyping, powered by Arm Cortex-A cores.

- **NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX, Nano, Xavier NX, Jetson Orin**

  Powerful Arm single-board computers designed for AI at the edge, supporting accelerated inference using integrated NVIDIA GPUs.

- **Any device running Arm Cortex‑A processors**

  This includes a wide ecosystem of embedded and edge hardware—if your device features a Cortex‑A CPU, you can likely run this project.

> _If your device is Arm-based, supports Python, and can run Ollama, you can likely adapt this learning path to your hardware._
