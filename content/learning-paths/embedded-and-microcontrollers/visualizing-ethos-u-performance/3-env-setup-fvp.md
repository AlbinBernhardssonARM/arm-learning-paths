Use the Corstone-320 Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) to simulate an Arm-based system and run your ExecuTorch-compiled model.

## Install the Corstone-320 FVP

Before you begin, make sure youâ€™ve completed the steps in the previous section to install ExecuTorch.

{{< notice note >}}
On macOS, you'll need to perform additional setup to support FVP execution.  
See the [FVPs-on-Mac GitHub repo](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/FVPs-on-Mac/) for instructions before continuing.
{{< /notice >}}

Run the setup script provided in the ExecuTorch examples directory:

```bash
cd $HOME/executorch/examples/arm
./setup.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula
```

This installs the FVP and extracts all necessary components. It also prints a command to configure your shell environment.

## Add the FVP to your system path

Run the following command to update your environment:

```bash
source $HOME/executorch/examples/arm/ethos-u-scratch/setup_path.sh
```
This ensures the FVP binaries are available in your terminal session.

## Verify your setup

Run a quick test to check that the FVP is working:

```bash
 ./examples/arm/run.sh --target=ethos-u85-256
```

This executes a built-in example on the Ethos-U85 configuration of the Corstone-320 platform.

{{% notice macOS %}}

On macOS, make sure Docker is running. FVPs execute inside a Docker container on macOS systems.

If you see example output from the platform, the setup is complete.

## Next steps
You're now ready to deploy and run your own model using ExecuTorch and the Corstone-320 FVP.
