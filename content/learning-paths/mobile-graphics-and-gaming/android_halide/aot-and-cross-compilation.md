## Ahead-of-time and cross-compilation
One of Halide’s standout features is the ability to compile image processing pipelines ahead-of-time (AOT), enabling developers to generate optimized binary code on their host machines rather than compiling directly on target devices. This AOT compilation process allows developers to create highly efficient libraries that run effectively across diverse hardware without incurring the runtime overhead associated with just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

Halide also supports robust cross-compilation capabilities. Cross-compilation means using the host version of Halide, typically running on a desktop Linux or macOS system—to target different architectures, such as ARM for Android devices. Developers can thus optimize Halide pipelines on their host machine, produce libraries specifically optimized for Android, and integrate them seamlessly into Android applications. The generated pipeline code includes essential optimizations and can embed minimal runtime support, further reducing workload on the target device and ensuring responsiveness and efficiency.

## Objective
In this section, we leverage the host version of Halide to perform AOT compilation of an image processing pipeline via cross-compilation. The resulting pipeline library is specifically tailored to Android devices (targeting, for instance, arm64-v8a ABI), while the compilation itself occurs entirely on the host system. This approach significantly accelerates development by eliminating the need to build Halide or perform JIT compilation on Android devices. It also guarantees that the resulting binaries are optimized for the intended hardware, streamlining the deployment of high-performance image processing applications on mobile platforms.

## Prepare Pipeline for Android
The procedure implemented in the following code demonstrates how Halide’s AOT compilation and cross-compilation features can be utilized to create an optimized image processing pipeline for Android. We will run Halide on our host machine (in this example, macOS) to generate a static library containing the pipeline function, which will later be invoked from an Android device. Below is a step-by-step explanation of this process.

Create a new file named blur-android.cpp with the following contents:

```cpp
#include "Halide.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace Halide;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <output_basename> \n";
        return 1;
    }

    std::string output_basename = argv[1];

    // Configure Halide Target for Android
    Halide::Target target;
    target.os = Halide::Target::OS::Android; 
    target.arch = Halide::Target::Arch::ARM;
    target.bits = 64;
    target.set_feature(Target::NoRuntime, false);

    // --- Define the pipeline ---
    // Define variables
    Var x("x"), y("y");

    // Define input parameter
    ImageParam input(UInt(8), 2, "input");

    // Create a clamped function that limits the access to within the image bounds
    Func clamped("clamped");
    clamped(x, y) = input(clamp(x, 0, input.width()-1),
                        clamp(y, 0, input.height()-1));

    // Now use the clamped function in processing
    RDom r(0, 3, 0, 3);
    Func blur("blur");

    // Initialize blur accumulation
    blur(x, y) = cast<uint16_t>(0);
    blur(x, y) += cast<uint16_t>(clamped(x + r.x - 1, y + r.y - 1));

    // Then continue with pipeline
    Func blur_div("blur_div");
    blur_div(x, y) = cast<uint8_t>(blur(x, y) / 9);

    // Thresholding
    Func thresholded("thresholded");
    Expr t = cast<uint8_t>(128);
    thresholded(x, y) = select(blur_div(x, y) > t, cast<uint8_t>(255), cast<uint8_t>(0));

    // Simple scheduling 
    blur_div.compute_root();
    thresholded.compute_root();

    // --- AOT compile to a file ---
    thresholded.compile_to_static_library(
        output_basename,      // base filename
        { input },            // list of inputs
        "blur_threshold",     // name of the generated function
        target
    );

    return 0;
}
```

The program takes at least one command-line argument, the output base name used to generate the files (e.g., “blur_threshold_android”). Here, the target architecture is explicitly set within the code to Android ARM64:

```cpp
// Configure Halide Target for Android
Halide::Target target;
target.os = Halide::Target::OS::Android; 
target.arch = Halide::Target::Arch::ARM;
target.bits = 64;
target.set_feature(Target::NoRuntime, false);
```

We declare spatial variables (x, y) and an ImageParam named “input” representing the input image data. We use boundary clamping (clamp) to safely handle edge pixels. Then, we apply a 3x3 blur with a reduction domain (RDom). The accumulated sum is divided by 9 (the number of pixels in the neighborhood), producing an average blurred image. Lastly, thresholding is applied, producing a binary output: pixels above a certain brightness threshold (128) become white (255), while others become black (0).

Simple scheduling directives (compute_root) instruct Halide to compute intermediate functions at the pipeline’s root, simplifying debugging and potentially enhancing runtime efficiency.

We invoke Halide’s AOT compilation function compile_to_static_library, which generates a static library (.a) containing the optimized pipeline and a corresponding header file (.h).

```cpp
thresholded.compile_to_static_library(
    output_basename,      // base filename for output files (e.g., "blur_threshold_android")
    { input },            // list of input parameters to the pipeline
    "blur_threshold",     // the generated function name
    target                // our target configuration for Android
);
```

This will produce:
* A static library (blur_threshold_android.a) containing the compiled pipeline.
* A header file (blur_threshold_android.h) declaring the pipeline function for use in other C++/JNI code.

These generated files are then ready to integrate directly into an Android project via JNI, allowing efficient execution of the optimized pipeline on Android devices. The integration process is covered in the next section.

## Compilation instructions
To compile the pipeline-generation program on your host system, use the following commands (replace /path/to/halide with your Halide installation directory):
```console
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/halide/lib/libHalide.19.dylib
g++ -std=c++17 camera-capture.cpp -o camera-capture \
    -I/path/to/halide/include -L/path/to/halide/lib -lHalide \
    $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4) -lpthread -ldl \
    -Wl,-rpath,/path/to/halide/lib
```

Then execute the binary:
```console
./blur_android blur_threshold_android
```

This will produce two files:
* blur_threshold_android.a: The static library containing your Halide pipeline.
* blur_threshold_android.h: The header file needed to invoke the generated pipeline.

We will integrate these files into our Android project in the following section.

## Summary
In this section, we’ve explored Halide’s powerful ahead-of-time (AOT) and cross-compilation capabilities, preparing an optimized image processing pipeline tailored specifically for Android devices. By using the host-based Halide compiler, we’ve generated a static library optimized for ARM64 Android architecture, incorporating safe boundary conditions, neighborhood-based blurring, and thresholding operations. This streamlined process allows seamless integration of highly optimized native code into Android applications, ensuring both development efficiency and runtime performance on mobile platforms.
