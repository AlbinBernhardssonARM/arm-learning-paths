In the previous section, you built the Voice Assistant application. Now, you will install this application on your Android phone. The easiest way to do this is to put your Android phone in developer mode and use a USB cable to upload the application.

## Switch your phone to developer mode

By default, developer mode is not active on Android phones. You will need to activate it by following [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

## Upload the Voice Assistant to your phone

Once your phone is in developer mode, plug it into the USB cable: it should appear as a running device in the top bar. Select it and then press the run button (small red circle in figure 4 below). This will transfer the app to the phone and launch it.

In the picture below, a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 phone has been connected to the USB cable:

## Run the Voice Assistant

The Voice Assistant will welcome you with this screen:

You can now use the Press to Talk at the bottom and make your request!
