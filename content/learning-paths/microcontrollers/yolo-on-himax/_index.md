title: Run Yolo computer vision model on a Himax microcontroller

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introduction topic for beginners on how to run a computervision application on an embedded device from Himax. This example uses an off-the-shelf Himax WiseEye2 module which is based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U85.

learning_objectives: 
    - Run Yolo model on off-the-shelf hardware based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U55
    - Build Himax SDK and generate firmware image file
    - Update firmware on edge device (Himax WiseEye2)
    
prerequisites:
    - Seeed Grove Vision AI V2 Module
    - OV5647-62 Camera module and included FPC cable
    - A USB-C cable
    - An Linux-based PC on an x86 archiecture.
