title: Run Yolo computer vision model on a Himax microcontroller

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introduction topic for beginners on how to run a computervision application on an embedded device from Himax. This example uses an off-the-shelf Himax WiseEye2 module which is based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U85.

learning_objectives: 
    - Run Yolo model on off-the-shelf hardware based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U55
    - Build Himax SDK and generate firmware image file
    - Update firmware on edge device (Himax WiseEye2)
    

prerequisites:
    - [Seeed Grove Vision AI V2 Module](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Vision-AI-Module-V2-p-5851.html)
    - [OV5647-62 Camera module and included FPC cable](https://www.seeedstudio.com/OV5647-69-1-FOV-Camera-module-for-Raspberry-Pi-3B-4B-p-5484.html)
    - An Windows based machine running an x86 archiecture.
