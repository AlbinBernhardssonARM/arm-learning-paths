title: Run a Computer Vision Model on a Himax Microcontroller

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for: This is an introduction topic for beginners on how to run a computer vision application on an embedded device from Himax. This example uses an off-the-shelf Himax WiseEye2 module which is based on the Arm Cortex-M55 and Ethos-U55.

learning_objectives:
    - Run a you-only-look-once (YOLO) computer vision model on the edge device
    - Build the Himax Software Development Kit (SDK) and generate the firmware image file
    - Update the firmware on the edge device (Himax WiseEye2)

prerequisites:
    - A [Seeed Grove Vision AI Module V2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Vision-AI-Module-V2-p-5851.html) development board
    - A [OV5647-62 Camera Module](https://www.seeedstudio.com/OV5647-69-1-FOV-Camera-module-for-Raspberry-Pi-3B-4B-p-5484.html) and included FPC cable
    - A USB-C cable
    - An x86 based Linux machine or a machine running Apple Silicon
