## Install Git for Windows on Arm

This section uses a sample application from GitHub to demonstrate the use of Arm Performance Libraries.

Start by installing Git using the [Git Install Guide](/install-guides/git-woa/) for Windows on Arm.

## Clone the Sample from GitHub

The sample application renders a rotating 3D cube to perform the calculations using different programming options.

First, navigate to an empty directory and clone the example repository from GitHub:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/odincodeshen/SpinTheCubeInGDI.git
```

{{% notice Note %}}
The sample repository is forked from the [original GitHub repository](https://github.com/marcpems/SpinTheCubeInGDI) with some modifications for demonstration purposes.
