title: Build a Hands-Free Selfie app with Modern Android Development and MediaPipe Multimodal AI

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for mobile application developers interested in learning how to build an Android selfie app with MediaPipe, Kotlin flows and CameraX, following the [modern Android architecture](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-architecture) design.


learning_objectives: 
    - Architect a modern Android app with a focus on the [UI layer](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer).
    - Use [MediaPipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide)'s [face landmark detection](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker) and [gesture recognition](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/gesture_recognizer) for a holistic selfie solution.
    - Use [JetPack CameraX](https://developer.android.com/media/camera/camerax) to access camera features.
    - Use [Kotlin flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) to handle multiple asynchronous data streams.

prerequisites:
    - A development machine with [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.
    - A recent **physical** Android device (with **front camera**) and a USB **data** cable.
    - Familiarity with Android development concepts.
    - Basic knowledge of modern Android architecture.
    - Basic knowledge of Kotlin programming language, such as [coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).
