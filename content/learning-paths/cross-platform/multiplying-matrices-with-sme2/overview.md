## Arm's Scalable Matrix Extension Version 2 (SME2)

Armâ€™s Scalable Matrix Extension Version 2 (SME2) is a hardware feature designed to accelerate dense linear algebra operations, enabling high-throughput execution of matrix-based workloads. Whether you're building for AI inference, HPC, or scientific computing, SME2 provides fine-grained control and high-performance vector processing on Armv9-A systems.


### How SME2 extends the SME Architecture

The Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) is an extension to the Armv9-A architecture and is designed to accelerate matrix-heavy computations, such as outer products and matrix-matrix multiplications. 

SME2 builds on SME by accelerating vector operations to increase the number of applications that can benefit from the computational efficiency of SME, beyond its initial focus on outer products and matrix-matrix multiplication.

SME2 introduces multi-vector processing, new memory instructions, and enhanced predication to improve throughput and flexibility in compute-intensive applications.

### Key architectural features of SME2

SME2 adds several capabilities to the original SME architecture::

* **Multi-vector multiply-accumulate instructions**, with Z vectors as multiplier and multiplicand inputs and accumulating results into ZA array vectors, including widening multiplies that accumulate into more vectors than they read.

* **Multi-vector load, store, move, permute, and convert instructions**, that use multiple SVE Z vectors as source and destination registers to pre-process inputs and post-process outputs of the ZA-targeting SME2 instructions.

* **Predicate-as-counter mechanism**, which is an alternative predication mechanism that is added to the original SVE predication mechanism, to control operations performed on multiple vector registers.

* **Compressed neural network support** using dedicated lookup table instructions and outer product instructions that support binary neural networks.

* **A 512-bit architectural register ZT0**, that supports the lookup table feature.
