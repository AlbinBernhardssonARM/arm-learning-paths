## Vectorization on x86 and Arm

Migrating SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) code from x86 extensions to Arm extensions is an important task for software developers aiming to optimize performance on Arm platforms. 

Understanding the mapping between x86 instruction sets like SSE, AVX, and AMX to Arm's NEON, SVE, and SME extensions is essential for ensuring portability and high performance. This Learning Path provides an overview to help you design a migration plan, leveraging Arm features such as scalable vector lengths and advanced matrix operations, to effectively adapt your code.

Vectorization is a key optimization strategy where one instruction processes multiple data elements simultaneously. It drives performance in HPC, AI/ML, signal processing, and data analytics.  

Both x86 and Arm processors offer rich SIMD capabilities, but they differ in philosophy and design. The x86 architecture provides fixed-width vector units of 128, 256, and 512 bits. The Arm architecture offers a mix of fixed-width, for NEON,  and scalable vectors for SVE and SME ranging from 128 to 2048 bits.  

If you are interested in migrating SIMD software to Arm, understanding these differences ensures portable, high-performance code.

## Arm vector and matrix extensions

### NEON

NEON is a 128‑bit SIMD extension available across Armv8‑A cores (including Neoverse and mobile). It is well suited to multimedia, DSP, and packet processing. Conceptually, NEON is closest to x86 SSE (and AVX used in 128‑bit mode), making it the primary target when migrating SSE workloads. Compiler auto‑vectorization to NEON is mature, reducing the need for manual intrinsics.

### Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)

SVE introduces a revolutionary approach to SIMD with its vector-length agnostic (VLA) design. Registers in SVE can range from 128 to 2048 bits, with the exact width determined by the hardware implementation in multiples of 128 bits. This flexibility allows the same binary to run efficiently across different hardware generations. SVE also features advanced capabilities like per-element predication, which eliminates branch divergence, and native support for gather/scatter operations, enabling efficient handling of irregular memory accesses. While SVE is ideal for high-performance computing (HPC) and future-proof portability, developers must adapt to its unique programming model, which differs significantly from fixed-width SIMD paradigms. SVE is most similar to AVX-512 on x86, offering greater portability and scalability.

### Scalable Matrix Extension (SME)

SME is designed to accelerate matrix multiplication and is similar to AMX. Unlike AMX, which relies on dot-product-based operations, SME employs outer-product-based operations, providing greater flexibility for custom AI and HPC kernels. SME integrates seamlessly with SVE, utilizing scalable tiles and a streaming mode to optimize performance. It is particularly well-suited for AI training and inference workloads, as well as dense linear algebra in HPC applications.

### Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE)

The SSE instruction set provides 128-bit XMM registers and supports both integer and floating-point SIMD operations. Despite being an older technology, SSE remains a baseline for many libraries due to its widespread adoption. 

However, its fixed-width design can constrain throughput compared with newer extensions like AVX. When migrating code from SSE to Arm, developers will find that SSE maps well to Arm NEON, enabling a relatively straightforward transition.

### Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX)

AVX introduces 256‑bit YMM registers and AVX‑512 adds 512‑bit ZMM registers. Features include FMA, mask registers (AVX‑512), and VEX/EVEX encodings. Migrating AVX code to Arm typically maps 128‑bit work to NEON and vector‑scalable algorithms to SVE. Because SVE is VLA, refactoring for predication and scalable loops is recommended.

### Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX)

AMX accelerates matrix operations with **tile** registers configured via a tile palette. It suits AI workloads such as GEMM and convolutions. When migrating AMX kernels to Arm, target SME. While both target matrix compute, AMX commonly expresses **dot products**; SME focuses on **outer products**, so porting often entails algorithmic adjustments.

## Key differences for developers

### Vector length model

x86 SIMD (SSE/AVX/AVX‑512) uses fixed widths (128/256/512). This often requires multiple code paths or dispatch strategies. Arm NEON is also fixed at 128‑bit and is a familiar baseline. **SVE/SME** introduce **vector‑length agnostic** execution from 128 to 2048 bits so the same binary scales across implementations.

### Programming and intrinsics

x86 intrinsics are extensive, and AVX‑512 adds masks and lane controls that increase complexity. NEON intrinsics look familiar to SSE developers. SVE/SME use **predication** and scalable loops; prefer **auto‑vectorization** and VLA‑friendly patterns over heavy hand‑written intrinsics when portability matters.

### Matrix acceleration

AMX provides fixed‑geometry tile compute optimized for dot products. SME extends Arm’s scalable model with outer‑product math, scalable tiles, and streaming mode. Both AMX and SME are currently available on a **limited set of platforms**.

### Overall summary

Migrating from x86 SIMD to Arm entails adopting Arm’s **scalable** and **predicated** programming model (SVE/SME) for forward‑portable performance, while continuing to use NEON for fixed‑width SIMD similar to SSE.

## Migration tools

Several libraries help translate or abstract SIMD intrinsics to speed up migration. Coverage varies, and some features have no direct analogue.

- **sse2neon** — Open‑source header that maps many SSE2 intrinsics to NEON equivalents. Good for getting code building quickly; still review generated code for performance. <https://github.com/DLTcollab/sse2neon>
- **SIMD Everywhere (SIMDe)** — Header‑only portability layer that implements many x86/Arm intrinsics across ISAs, with scalar fallbacks when SIMD is unavailable. <https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde>
- **Google Highway (hwy)** — Portable SIMD library and APIs that target multiple ISAs (NEON, SVE where supported, AVX, etc.) for high‑performance data processing without per‑ISA code paths. <https://github.com/google/highway>
