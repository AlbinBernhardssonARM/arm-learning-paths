### The Challenge of SIMD Code Portability
One of the biggest challenges developers face when working with SIMD code is making it portable across different platforms. SIMD instructions are designed to improve performance by executing the same operation on multiple data elements in parallel. Each architecture has its own set of SIMD instructions however, making it difficult to write code that works on all of them without major changes to the code or the algorithm, or both.

For example, to port software written using Intel intrinsics, such as SSE/AVX/AVX512, to Arm Neon, you have pay attention to data handling with the different instruction sets.

Porting the code between architectures can increase development time and introduce the risk of errors. Currently, developers rely on ISA documentation and must manually search across various vendor platforms such as [Arm Developer](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets/intrinsics/) and [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html) to find equivalent instructions.

[SIMD.info](https://simd.info) aims to solve this problem by helping you find equivalent instructions and providing a more streamlined way to adapt your code for different architectures.
