## Setting Up Your Environment

In this initial example we will use an Arm-based AWS `t4g.2xlarge` instance along with the Arm Performance Libraries. For instructions to connect to an AWS instance, please see our [getting started guide](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/). 

Once connected via `ssh`, install the required packages with the following commands. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc make
```
Next, install Arm performance libraries using the following [installation guide](https://learn.arm.com/install-guides/armpl/). Alternatively, use the commands below. 

```bash
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/cdn-downloads/permalink/Arm-Performance-Libraries/Version_24.10/arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb_gcc.tar
tar xvf arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb_gcc.tar
cd arm-performance-libraries_24.10_deb/
```

Now we need to install environment modules to set the required environment variables, allowing us to quickly build the example applications. 

```bash
sudo add-apt-respository universe
sudo apt install environment-modules
source /usr/share/modules/init/bash
export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/opt/arm/modulefiles
module avail
```

You should see the following `armpl/24.10.0_gcc` available. 
```output
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- /opt/arm/modulefiles -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
armpl/24.10.0_gcc  
```

Load the module with the following command. 

```bash
module load armpl/24.10.0_gcc
```

Navigate to the `lp64` C source code examples and compile. 

```bash
cd $ARMPL_DIR
cd /examples_lp64/
sudo -E make c_examples // -E is to preserve environment variables
```

Your terminal output should show the examples being compiled, ending with.

```output
...
Test passed OK
```

For more information on all the available function, please refer to the [Arm Performance Libraries Reference Guide](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101004/latest/).
