## What is a RAG system?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation to enhance the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content.

The basic flow of a RAG system includes:

1. Retrieval: the system searches a knowledge base using a combination of vector and/or text search.
2. Augmentation: the retrieved information is added as context to a generative AI model to provide additional context for the user's query.
3. Generation: the AI model uses both the retrieved knowledge and its internal understanding to generate a more useful response to the user.

The benefits of a RAG system center around improved factual accuracy of responses and the ability to integrate up-to-date information, as you can update the knowledge base without retraining the model. 

Most importantly, RAG lets you provide reference links to the user, showing the user where the information originates.
