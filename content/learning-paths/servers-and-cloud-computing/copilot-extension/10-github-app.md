Now we need to create a Copilot extension on GitHub to connect to our deployed application.

## Creating a GitHub app

> For the most up to date instructions, follow the [official documentation for creating a GitHub App for Copilot Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/creating-a-copilot-extension/creating-a-github-app-for-your-copilot-extension#creating-a-github-app).

On any page of [GitHub](https://github.com/), click your profile picture and go to Settings. Scroll down to developer settings, and create a GitHub App.

Your GitHub App must have:
    - A name
    - A homepage URL
    - Webhooks deselected

After you create your app, click **Install App** in the sidebar, then install your app on your account.
