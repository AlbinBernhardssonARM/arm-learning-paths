minutes_to_complete: 45

who_is_this_for: This learning path is designed for Java developers aiming to optimize application performance on Arm-based servers. It is especially valuable for those migrating applications from x86-based to Arm-based instances. Here, you'll learn about essential garbage collection (GC) tuning parameters and how to adjust them to meet your specific performance needs. 

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand the key differences among Java garbage collectors (GCs).
    - Monitor and interpret GC performance metrics.
    - Adjust core parameters to optimize performance for your specific workload

prerequisites:
    - Access to an Arm-based server
    - Basic understanding of Java
    - Java installed on your system
