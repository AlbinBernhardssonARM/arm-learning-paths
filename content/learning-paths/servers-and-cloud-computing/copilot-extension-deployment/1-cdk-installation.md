## Infrastructure as Code

AWS CDK is an AWS-native Infrastructure as Code tool that allows cloud engineers to write IaC templates in many different languages. Regardless of the language used, all CDK code eventually transpiles to TypeScript, and the TypeScript generates CloudFormation templates, which then deploy the specified resources.

This Learning Path will use the Python flavor of AWS CDK, because the Copilot Extension that will be deployed is also written in Python. Writing both IaC and application code in the same language is helpful for certain teams, especially those without dedicated platform engineers.

## Installing AWS CDK

To install the required packages, you will first need npm and Python installed.
