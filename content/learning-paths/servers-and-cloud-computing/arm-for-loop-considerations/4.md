## Adding Context

In some situations, you may already know that a loop will run a multiple of a constant—like 4. Making this explicit can help the compiler avoid generating “cleanup” code for leftover iterations.


Original:

```cpp
for (n = 0; n < n_coefs; n++) {
    // ...
}
```

If n_coefs is always a multiple of four, you can rewrite:

```cpp
for (n = 0; n < ((n_coefs / 4) * 4); n++) {
    // ...
}
```

or:


```cpp
for (n = 0; n < n_coefs_by_4 * 4; n++) {
    // ...
}
```

In the second version, n_coefs_by_4 equals n_coefs / 4, and you pass that in instead of n_coefs.
