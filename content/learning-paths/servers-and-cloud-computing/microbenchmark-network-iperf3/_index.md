title: Microbenchmark and tune network performance with iPerf3 and Linux traffic control

whminutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for performance engineers, Linux system administrators, or application developers who want to microbenchmark, simulate, or tune the networking performance of distributed systems.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand how to use iPerf3 for network microbenchmarking.
    - Use Linux Traffic Control (TC) to simulate different network conditions.
    - Identify and apply basic runtime parameters to tune performance.

prerequisites:
    - Foundational understanding of networking principles such as TCP/IP and UDP.
    - Access to two [Arm-based cloud instances](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/).
