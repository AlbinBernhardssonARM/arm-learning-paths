title: Deploy ModelScope Chinese Speech Recognition Model FunASR on Arm Servers

minutes_to_complete: 60

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers and AI engineers interested in learning how to build Chinese ASR applications on Arm servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Leverage pre-trained model community from Chinese community.
    - Build open-source Chinese ASR function on Arm Neoverse.
    - Utilize FunASR for speech recognition tasks, including real-time, sentiment analysis, and keyword enhancement.
    - Understand how Arm CPUs accelerate ModelScope models for performance and efficiency.

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm-based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider, or a local Arm Linux computer with at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM.
