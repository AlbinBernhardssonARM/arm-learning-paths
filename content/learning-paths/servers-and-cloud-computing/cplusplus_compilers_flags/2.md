If you are new to cloud computing, please refer to [Getting started with Servers and Cloud Computing](https://learn.arm.com/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/intro/). It provides an introduction to the Arm servers available from various cloud service providers. 

## Connect to an AWS Arm-based instance

In this example you will build and run a C++ application on an AWS Graviton 4 (`r8g.xlarge`) instance running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. 

Create the AWS instance using your AWS account. Connect to the instance using SSH or AWS Session Manager so you can enter shell commands. 

Once connected, run the following commands to confirm the operating system and architecture.

```bash
cat /etc/*lsb*
```

You see output similar to:

```output
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=24.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=noble
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS"
```

Next, confirm we are using a 64-bit Arm-based system using the following command

```bash
uname -m
```

You see the following output:

```output
aarch64
```

## Enable environment modules

Environment modules is a tool to quickly modify your shell configuration and environment variables. For this activity, it allows you to quickly switch between different compiler versions to demonstrate potential improvements. 

First, you need to install the environment modules package. 

In your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install environment-modules
```

Load environment modules after the package is installed: 

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/modules/init/bash
source /usr/share/modules/init/bash
```

Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install multiple compiler versions on your Ubuntu system. For this example you can install GCC version 9 to demonstrate potential improvements your application could achieve. 

Install GCC version 9:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9 -y
```

Create a module file for each compiler installed. 

```bash
mkdir -p ~/modules/gcc
```

Use a text editor to modify the file `~/modules/gcc/9`

Copy and paste the text below into the file and save it.

```console
#%Module1.0
prepend-path PATH /usr/bin/gcc-9
prepend-path PATH /usr/bin/g++-9
```
