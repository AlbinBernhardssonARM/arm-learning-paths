## Exploring the Memory Model More Deeply

In this Learning Path we took a practical approach to exploring the Arm memory model and thread synchronization. If the reader would like to explore this topic more deeply and more formally, we recommend reading through the following blog series.

- [A working example of how to use the herd7 Memory Model Tool](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/how-to-use-the-memory-model-tool)
- [How to generate litmus tests automatically with the diy7 tool](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/generate-litmus-tests-automatically-diy7-tool)
- [Running litmus tests on hardware using litmus7](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/running-litmus-tests-on-hardware-litmus7)
- [Expanding the Memory Model Tools to System-level architecture](https://community.arm.com/arm-community-blogs/b/architectures-and-processors-blog/posts/expanding-memory-model-tools-system-level-architecture)

Also, the [diy7 documentation](https://diy.inria.fr/doc/index.html) links to a few papers that explore memory models more formally.

## Docs on Barriers

- [Barriers on Armv8](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100941/0101/Barriers).
- [Load-Acquire and Store-Release on Armv8](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102336/0100/Load-Acquire-and-Store-Release-instructions).
- [Barrier Litmus Tests and Cookbook](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/genc007826/latest). This was written during the Armv7 days, but it still has relevance.

## More Tests to Explore

There are many more tests that can be explored in the [herd7 simulator tool](https://developer.arm.com/herd7).
