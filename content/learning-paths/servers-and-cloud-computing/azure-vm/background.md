## Introduction to Azure Linux 3.0

Azure Linux 3.0 is Microsoft's in-house, lightweight Linux distribution optimized for running cloud-native workloads on Azure. Designed with performance, security, and reliability in mind, it is fully supported by Microsoft and tailored for containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. With native support for Arm64 (Aarch64) architecture, Azure Linux 3.0 enables efficient execution of workloads on energy-efficient ARM-based infrastructure, making it a powerful choice for scalable and cost-effective cloud deployments.

As of now, the Azure Marketplace offers official VM images of Azure Linux 3.0 only for x64-based architectures, published by Ntegral Inc. However, native Arm64 (Aarch64) images are not yet officially available. This learning path bridges that gap by guiding developers through the process of building a custom Arm VM image using the Azure Linux 3.0 ISO. By the end of this path, you'll be able to deploy and run Azure Linux 3.0 VMs on Arm-based Azure infrastructure with confidence.
