The tools and services that you will use in this learning path come from an open-source project called Veraison. Veraison (pronounced “ver-ayy-sjon”) is a project that was founded within Arm but has since been donated to the Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) as an ongoing community project with a growing number of contributors from other organisations.

Veraison focuses on the verification aspect of attestation. It provides reusable tools and components that can be used to construct verification services or libraries.

Confidential computing is a new and fast-growing industry. There are many stakeholders including hardware manufacturers, firmware vendors, service providers, application developers, end users and regulators. Attestation is an end-to-end process that has the potential to impact all of them. Good alignment and interoperability are essential. The Veraison project is being developed in parallel with several standardisation efforts across various industry bodies. Veraison demonstrates the effectiveness of these standards in practice, facilitates their ongoing development within open communities, and makes it possible to build functioning software from them.

In this learning path, you will use some of the command-line tools that Veraison provides. You will also make use of an attestation verifier service that is built entirely from Veraison components.
