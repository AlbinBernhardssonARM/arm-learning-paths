title: Build Boot and Customize Arm RD V3 Software on Arm Servers

minutes_to_complete: 90

who_is_this_for:   This Learning Path is for CSS platform firmware developers, system architects, and silicon verification engineers working on Arm-based cloud and infrastructure-class systems. You’ll learn how to build, customize, and validate firmware on the RD‑V3 platform using Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs) before hardware is available.

learning_objectives: 
    - Understand the architecture of Arm Neoverse CSS‑V3 and how it forms the basis for scalable compute subsystems
    - Build and boot the RD‑V3 platform using standard firmware components like TF‑A, SCP, RSE, and UEFI
    - Simulate multi-core, multi-chip server-class systems using Arm FVP models and interpret boot logs for debugging and validation
    - Modify platform control code to test custom logic and validate it using pre-silicon simulation

prerequisites:
    - Arm-based Neoverse cloud instances, or local Arm Neoverse Linux system with at least 80 GB of storage
    - Basic experience with Linux and terminal-based development
    - Familiarity with the concept of firmware boot flow and system-on-chip (SoC) architecture
    - Docker installed, or access to a Codespaces-compatible development environment
