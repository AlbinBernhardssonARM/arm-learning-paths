## Azure Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure Cobalt 100 is Microsoftâ€™s first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor built on Arm Neoverse N2. It is a 64-bit CPU that targets cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads such as web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, and caching, delivering strong performance and energy efficiency. Running at 3.4 GHz, Cobalt 100 allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU to provide consistent, predictable performance.
