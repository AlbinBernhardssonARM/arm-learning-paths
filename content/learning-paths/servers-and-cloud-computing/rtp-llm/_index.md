title: Run an LLM chatbot with rtp-llm on Arm-based servers

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers who are interested in running a Large Language Model (LLM) with rtp-llm on Arm-based servers. 

learning_objectives:
    - Build rtp-llm on an Arm-based server.
    - Download a Qwen model from Hugging Face.
    - Run a Large Language Model with rtp-llm.

prerequisites:
    - An Arm Neoverse N2 or Neoverse V2 [based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider or an on-premise Arm server. This Learning Path has been deployed on an AliCloud Yitian710 g8y.8xlarge instance and an AWS Graviton4 r8g.8xlarge instance to test Arm performance optimizations.
