who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers looking to migrate their applications to Arm-based servers using a code analysis tool called migrate-ease. You can leverage this tool to scan source code repositories to identify porting issues you might encounter before migrating your code to run on Arm-based servers.


learning_objectives:
    - Examine your application's source code for architecture-specific dependencies
    - Understand common migration challenges and their corresponding solutions
    - Use migrate-ease to detect and address AArch64 code portability concerns

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider.
