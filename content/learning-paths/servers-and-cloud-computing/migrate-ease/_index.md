who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers looking to migrate their applications to Arm-based servers using a code analysis tool called migrate-ease. You can leverage this tool to identify  code portability to Arm challenges early in the migration process.


learning_objectives:
    - Analyze your application source code for architecture-specific dependencies
    - Understand common migration challenges and solutions
    - Use migrate-ease to identify and prioritize portability issues

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/servers-and-cloud-computing/csp/) from a cloud service provider.
