## Manage risk with functional safety principles

At its core, functional safety is about managing risk and reducing the impact of system failures.

In autonomous vehicles, for example, functional safety ensures that if sensor data is incorrect, the system can enter a safe state and prevent dangerous driving decisions.

The three core objectives of functional safety are:

- **Prevention** reduces the likelihood of errors through rigorous software development processes and testing. For example, electric vehicles monitor battery temperature to prevent overheating.

- **Detection** quickly identifies errors using built-in diagnostic mechanisms, such as built-in self-test routines.

- **Mitigation** controls the impact of failures to ensure the system stays safe, even when things go wrong.

These three principles form the foundation for building safer, more reliable software systems.

This approach is critical in systems like autonomous vehicles and medical devices, where failures can have serious consequences.
