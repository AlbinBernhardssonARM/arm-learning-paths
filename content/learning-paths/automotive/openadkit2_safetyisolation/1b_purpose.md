## Functional safety: purpose and risk management principles


The core of Functional Safety lies in risk management, which aims to reduce the impact of system failures.

In autonomous vehicles, Functional Safety ensures that if sensor data is incorrect, the system can enter a safe state, preventing incorrect driving decisions.

The three core objectives of Functional Safety are:
1. Prevention: Reducing the likelihood of errors through rigorous software development processes and testing. In electric vehicles, battery systems monitor temperature to prevent overheating.
2. Detection: Quickly identifying errors using built-in diagnostic mechanisms, such as built-in self-test.
3. Mitigation: Controlling the impact of failures to ensure the overall safety of the system.

This approach is critical in applications such as autonomous driving, flight control, and medical implants, where failures can result in severe consequences.
