## Why functional safety matters 

Functional safety refers to a system's ability to detect potential faults and respond appropriately to ensure that the system remains in a safe state, preventing harm to individuals or damage to equipment. 

This is particularly important in automotive, autonomous driving, medical devices, industrial control, robotics and aerospace applications, where system failures can lead to severe consequences.

In software development, functional safety focuses on minimizing risks through software design, testing, and validation to ensure that critical systems operate in a predictable, reliable, and verifiable manner. 

This means developers must consider:

- Error detection mechanisms
- Exception handling
- Redundancy design
- Development processes compliant with safety standards

In the following sections, you'll explore how to apply these principles throughout the software lifecycle, which ranges from risk assessment and architectural design to runtime isolation and compliance with ISO 26262.
