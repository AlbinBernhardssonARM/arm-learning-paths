## Implement safety-critical isolation with Safety Island architecture

In automotive systems, a General ECU (Electronic Control Unit) typically runs non-critical tasks such as infotainment or navigation, whereas a Safety Island is dedicated to executing safety-critical control logic (for example, braking and steering) with strong isolation, redundancy, and determinism.

The table below compares the characteristics of a General ECU and a Safety Island in terms of their role in supporting Functional Safety.

| Feature               | General ECU                | Safety Island                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Purpose               | Comfort/non-safety logic | Safety-critical decision making      |
| OS/Runtime            | Linux, Android             | RTOS, Hypervisor, or bare-metal      |
| Isolation             | Soft partitioning          | Hard isolation (hardware-enforced)   |
| Functional Safety Req | None to moderate           | ISO 26262 ASIL-B to ASIL-D compliant |
| Fault Handling        | Best-effort recovery       | Deterministic safe-state response    |

This contrast highlights why safety-focused software needs a dedicated hardware domain with certified execution behavior.

Safety Island is an independent safety subsystem separate from the main processor. It is responsible for monitoring and managing system safety. If the main processor fails or becomes inoperable, Safety Island can take over critical safety functions such as deceleration, stopping, and fault handling to prevent catastrophic system failures.

Key Capabilities of Safety Island
- System Health Monitoring  
   - Continuously monitors the operational status of the main processor (for example, ADAS control unit, ECU) and detects potential errors or anomalies.
- Fault Detection and Isolation
   - Independently evaluates and initiates emergency handling if the main processing unit encounters errors, overheating, computational failures, or unresponsiveness.
- Providing Essential Safety Functions
   - Even if the main system crashes, Safety Island can still execute minimal safety operations, such as:
   - Autonomous Vehicles → Safe stopping (fail-safe mode)
   - Industrial Equipment → Emergency power cutoff or speed reduction

## Why Safety Island Matters for Functional Safety

Safety Island plays a critical role in Functional Safety by ensuring that the system can handle high-risk scenarios and minimize catastrophic failures.

How Safety Island Enhances Functional Safety
1. Acts as an Independent Redundant Safety Layer
   - Even if the main system fails, it can still operate independently.
2. Supports ASIL-D Safety Level
   - Monitors ECU health status and executes emergency safety strategies, such as emergency braking.
3. Provides Independent Fault Detection and Recovery Mechanisms
   - Fail-Safe: Activates a safe mode, such as limiting vehicle speed or switching to manual control.
   - Fail-Operational: Ensures that high-safety applications, such as aerospace systems, can continue operating under certain conditions.
