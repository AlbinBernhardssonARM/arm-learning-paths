The Eclipse Cyclone DDS is an open-source implementation of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, designed for high-performance, real-time, and scalable communication in autonomous systems, robotics, industrial IoT, and aerospace applications.
It is part of the Eclipse Foundation and is widely used in ROS 2 as a key middleware for inter-process communication.

## Before you begin

ROS2 is available for Linux, macOS and Windows.
This article provides a quick solution to install Cyclone DDS on Linux.

Confirm you are using an Arm machine by running:

```bash
uname -m
```

The output should be:

```output
aarch64
```

If you see a different result, you are not using an Arm computer running 64-bit Linux.

Also, you need install following before building Cyclone DDS:

- C Compiler (i.e. GCC).
- GIT.
- CMAKE (3.7 or later).
- OpenSSL (1.1 or later)

## How do I build Cyclone DDS on Arm?

We will install Cyclone DDS from source code.
Clone the GitHub link and create a build folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds.git
```

Once download, you can build and install Cyclone DDS on Linux.
In order to verify the installation, we enable `BUILD_EXAMPLES` and `BUILD_TESTING` for further testing. 

```bash
cd cyclonedds
mkdir build
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-location> ..
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```

{{% notice Note %}}
The two cmake --build commands might require being executed with sudo depending on the <install-location>.
{{% /notice %}}


## Quick test on Cyclone DDS

After success build up the code, you are able to use Cyclone DDS now.
To verify the installation, you can run the Hello World example on cyclonedds/build/bin folder.

Open two terminals and move to the cyclonedds/build/bin/ directory and in each terminal run:

{{< tabpane code=true >}}
  {{< tab header="Publisher" language="bash">}}
    cd cyclonedds/build/bin/
    ./HelloworldPublisher
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab header="Subscriber" language="bash">}}
    cd cyclonedds/build/bin/
    ./HelloworldSubscriber
  {{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

If you observe the following message from each of terminal, it's mean Cyclone DDS has been successfully installed on Arm machine.
You are now ready to use Cyclone DDS. 

{{< tabpane code=true >}}
  {{< tab header="Publisher" language="log">}}
    === [Publisher]  Waiting for a reader to be discovered ...
    === [Publisher]  Writing : Message (1, Hello World)
  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab header="Subscriber" language="log">}}
    === [Subscriber] Waiting for a sample ...
    === [Subscriber] Received : Message (1, Hello World)
  {{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}
